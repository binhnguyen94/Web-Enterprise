# Enterprise Web Software Development
We are group 3 of University of Greenwich. This is a project of COMP1640. Main technology is HTML/CSS/Javascript (Frontend) and PHP (Backend). Here is a link video demo: shorturl.at/lCGPR
# Specification
We are required to build a web-based secure role-based system for collecting student contributions for an annual university magazine in a large university.
The system must meet the following criteria:
- The University has a Marketing Manager to oversee the process.
- All Faculties have a Marketing Coordinator who is responsible for managing the
process for their Faculty.
- All students have the opportunity to submit one or more articles as Word documents
to the magazine.
- All students can also upload high quality images, e.g. photographs.
- All new contributions are disabled after a closure date for new entries, but updates
can continue to be done until a final closure date.
- All students must agree to Terms and Conditions before they can submit.
- Once a contribution is submitted the system emails a notification to the Facultyâ€™s
Marketing Coordinator, who must make a comment within 14 days.
- A Marketing Coordinator can only access contributions by students in their Faculty.
- Each Marketing Coordinator needs to be able to interact with the students in their Faculty in order to edit the contributions and to select those for publication.
- The University Marketing Manager can view all the selected contributions but cannot edit any. They need to be able to download all the selected contributions
after the final closure date in a ZIP file for transfer out of the system.
- An administrator maintains any system data, e.g. closure dates for each academic
year.
- A guest account for each Faculty can be used to view the selected reports.
- Statistical analysis (e.g. number of contributions per Faculty) needs to be available.

- The interface must be suitable for all devices (eg mobile phones, tablets, desktops).

Reports
A number of reports need to be made available. For example
- Statistics
o Number of contributions within each Faculty for each academic year.
o Percentage of contributions by each Faculty for any academic year.
o Number of contributors within each Faculty for each academic year.
- Exception reports
o Contributions without a comment.
o Contributions without a comment after 14 days.

After finishing a coursewwork, we still lack of an email notification function. We will try our best for other project better later beacause of some experiences in group work and new techhnology.
